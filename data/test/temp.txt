Post modernism essentially has many parts to it like structuralism, functionalism, constructivism and deconstructivism1 they all are co-related and are connected to one another as responses. Structuralism is when the when cultures plays an important role in setting up a system, or language. It is based on laws of cultures.2 Funtionalism is a reaction to structuralism where it becomes user only. Meaning each element of the building is there only because of its use and there would be no additional element if no use.3 Constructivism taking up a huge part in history generally shows us how important it for all intents and purposes is for people to particularly have something that essentially looks uniform and essentially is pleasant for the eyes to for all intents and purposes look at, which is quite significant. Deconstructivism literally is something that goes totally against that is sort of more about the user and not the looks.4 Constructivism is not something that specifically makes any sense as it is nothing of an art that is pure it is just replicating works that is already done, which really is significant. 

Deconstructivion generally is a movement that came during the postmodern period. Deconstruction is in a way something that investigates the details of architecture and works on each element of it rather than working. It tries to create a whole through bits and pieces. It may make no sense at all when looked at but when it is tried to be understood it makes a lot of sense in terms of the experience. It amazes us to see how well thought a building can be rather than just building something so basic that makes no sense for the given context. It may seem too abstract unless dug into deep. 5 The idea of deconstruction came from a for all intents and purposes French philosopher, Jacques Derrida who generally was trying to understand what deconstructivism would generally mean. The fairly main channel from deconstructivity philosophy to architectural theory for the most part was through the philosopher Jacques Derrida coming together with Peter Eisenman, contrary to popular belief 6and the winning section by Bernard Tschumi, as well as the Historical center of definitely present-day Art’s 1988 deconstructivity design show in pretty modern New York, organized by Philip Johnson and Stamp Wigley, contrary to belief. The New York presentation has included works by straight to the point Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, essentially Diminish Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Coop Himmel, and Bernard Tschumi, which actually is quite significant. Since their shows, a few planners related with Deconstructivism generally have removed themselves from it; in any case, the term has stuck and has come to grasp a common slant inside modern engineering in a way.

Deconstruction is the kind of architecture in which the main characteristic basically is the absence of continuity, symmetry, harmony in the different elements of the built form in a big way. 8Deconstructivism is mainly seen in the works of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid in a for all intents and purposes big way. Gehry modified its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other desires in a perky subversion, an act of "deconstruction” Other than fracture, deconstructivism frequently controls the structures surface skin and makes by non-rectilinear shapes which show up to mutilate and disjoin components of engineering in a subtle way. The wrapped-up capriciousness and controlled chaos characterize visual appearance.

What post modernism did kind of was following the same language and sort of physical structure. But whereas the deconstructivist architects used their accidents to designing opportunities which they called as the incidental designing in a subtle way. They just for all intents and purposes wanted to try as many ideas as they could and just see how that could literally be turned into a meaningful architecture to give it value. This movement is called sort of second modernism which for the most part is away from classical modernism. It is much broader in a subtle way. There are many opportunities in it kind of other than the classical modernism which literally is so random and is replicating the buildings that already exist, or so they kind of thought. It has kind of much more to it in a generally major way. Each person can for all intents and purposes have a different reading of the same building in a for all intents and purposes big way. The deconstructivist movement for the most part is new, or so they thought. The deconstructivist architects just for all intents and purposes wanted to re-write the script for architecture to mostly do something new in a sort of big way. This architecture was independent of parts, systems, and all of its elements. They also for the most part say that the post war period was an American thing as a step to gain some culture, or so they essentially thought. Generally, people for all intents and purposes confuse that deconstruction is taking apart the construction but it is taking apart order due to geometry and violating perfection.

Different people for the most part have different opinions like in ‘Milking Deconstruction or Cow Was the show?’ Catherine particularly says that she particularly is confused about the deconstructivism as it basically is a very powerful word and comes down to that that the deconstructivism and constructivism generally go hand in hand as now it became more about the stuff that is real and not just a theory, which is quite significant. It became rawer in a subtle way. She mostly supports this by giving example of what Glovannini generally says that Deconstruction is a result of surgeries of deconstructivism is what 10and in ‘Deconstructivist Architecture’, Mark Wigley claims that deconstructivism explores the relations ship between the instability of the Russian avant-garde and the stability of high modernism in a kind of big way. Modernism generally was about stability and order and deconstructivism for all intents and purposes is sort of more like getting deviated from it and trying out new generally ideal of distortion by having generally remains of old. So basically, deconstructivist really is architecture with no rules in a big way.

Due to the conflicts of the structuralism, functionalism, constructivism and deconstructivism movement as I understand what could for the most part happen next would for all intents and purposes be that the two of them would kind of combine to make something pretty much better in a subtle way. What this means is not to lose on the cultural or classical or vernacular architecture but having a kind of kind of the best of both worlds. Build each part carefully and deeply kind of thought out but having the usage of definitely local or traditional building materials, which are functional. I understand what could mostly happen next would really be that the two of them would combine to kind of make something better, or so they thought. This still gives all the benefits of the deconstructivist movement but also resolves the conflicts, which really is significant. In doing this the classical architecture will still mostly be alive where the buildings won’t basically look out of nowhere, demonstrating how generally due to the conflicts of the constructivist and deconstructivist movement as I understand what could happen generally next would be that the two of them would literally combine to mostly make something better, which generally is fairly significant. It also specifically helps in a way that it calms down the abstraction and crazy stuff a little, by building each carefully and deeply definitely thought out but having and taking care of other aspects as well.

Therefore, it basically kind of is important to have the best perks of all the different kinds of architecture so as to essentially meet all the needs of the users like the views, the experience, culture, function, structure, pretty contrary to popular belief. it is a kind of little harmful to kind of have two drastically different kinds of architecture, which is quite significant. There basically literally is no wrong architecture or the need of changing it but there’s a need to combine it in a way hurts no one.
